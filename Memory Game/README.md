# Dementia
## The childhood memory card game
### On steroids

Think you've got a good memory? Or maybe you need a little memory workout to bring it back up to speed? Well this little game will be sure to challenge your memory limits.

## How to Build

No frameworks. No transpilers. No compilers. No npm. No nothing. This is straight up "vanilla" JS. Just clone this repo and open index.html in your browser.

But be warned, this game uses cutting-edge JS features, so you will need the most recent version of whatever browser you are using to play it. And even then it may not work. Currently it is working for me in Firefox/Chrome/Edge. But I may make future changes that break it for certain browsers until they catch up with current JS standards. Or I may decide to try an "experimental" feature that not all browsers support.

## How to Play

If you just want to play the game, you can always find the most current version at:
